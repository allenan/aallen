I have been meaning to set up a homepage for myself for some time now. I'm connected to the internet for most of my waking day and I make my living building things for the internet. It makes sense that I should have my own personal corner of it.

I have even started building a site for myself a few times in the past, but the main sticking point was the lack of the right platform. I've made Wordpress and Drupal sites for clients before, but a full-blown CMS seemed like to much overhead for what I really wanted, which was a mostly static site with a few areas that would be easy to update. Static HTML is refreshing to write; you don't have to play by the rules of a CMS with tens of thousands of lines of code at its core, but you also don't get any of the niceties that come with a mature platform.

This is where Octopress came in. I saw that it was built on Jekyll, a Ruby-based static site generator that I had used in the past and enjoyed. But Octopress is geared toward developers looking to set up a simple site and it has exactly that community behind it, full of github repos of themes and plugins to do exactly the sorts of things I was looking to do.

In the interest of getting something live before I get zoned in on another project, I'll leave the default theme in place for now while I work on my own custom one.
