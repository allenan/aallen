I make applications for the web.

These applications leverage the ubiquity and familiarity of the web browser while accomplishing tasks that would have been relegated to desktop software only a few years ago.

My skills range from frontend to backend with a strong interest in machine learning, natural langauge processing and big data analysis.

I'm currently developing with Ruby on Rails and experimenting with some javascript MVC frameworks such as Ember and Backbone.

I work full time leading a New Technology effort at [LiveWatch Security](http://livewatch.com). We're bringing industry changing technology to the home security sector.
